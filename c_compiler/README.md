# CCC 
# This is my version of gcc, compiler for c language, ccc !

## how does the installation work?
When you run install.sh it installs ccc into the bin folder in your system root, which allows you to run it anytime

## How to install ?
to install the program just run the install.sh script

```bash
./install.sh
```

### Permission denied error
if you have this error, just assign the permissions by typing in the terminal

```shell script
sudo chmod +x install.sh
```

The same rules apply to uninstall ccc


## How to run ccc ?
To run ccc is very simple, just like gcc, just type 

```shell
ccc program_name.c
```

it will compile your program, generate an output file, run the program and at the end of the execution delete the output file, all this before you even drink your coffee

clearly it is necessary to have [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/) installed for it to work
