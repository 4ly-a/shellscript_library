# This is my version of gcc, compiler for c language, ccc !

## how does the installation work?
When you run install.sh it installs ccc into the bin folder in your system root, which allows you to run it anytime

## How to run ccc ?
To run ccc is very simple, just like gcc, just type 

```shell

```

it will compile your program, generate an output file, run the program and at the end of the execution delete the output file, all this before you even drink your coffee
